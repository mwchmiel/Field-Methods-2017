# Field Methods 2017 Resources, Portland State University

This repository was created as a follow up resource for students who may want to venture into ecological assessment using R. 

This repo contains the following:

* .gitattributes, .gitignore: These files basically have to do with the interaction with git and github.
* FM2.xls: An excel file that includes the calculations for the Shannon Diversity Index and Hutcheson t-test done by hand
* FMinsectdata.csv: A comma separated values file of our species x site matrix. This is what we will read into R.
* Field Methods Diversity.R: R code for importing the .csv file and generating Shannon Diversity and Horn's index of community similarity
* Readme.md: A markdown file. This is what you are reading right now. 
* Shannon t P UPGMA.xls: The summary of Shannon, Horn, and the Hutcheson t, as well as Ruedas' UPGMA calculations for 2016-2017
* similarity.csv: A file generated by the R code that outputs our Horn values. 

*Regardings Data:* 

The dataset included drops Annelids, Molluscs, and Nematodes from the raw dataset for 2017. It also bins some groups of arthropods to better match the categories defined by the 2016 dataset.
